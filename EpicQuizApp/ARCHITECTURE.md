# Epic Quiz App - React Native Architecture

## 🎯 Foundation Complete ✅

A mobile-first educational quiz app for classical literature, built with React Native and TypeScript.

## 📱 Core Structure Implemented

### ✅ Design System
- **Colors**: Sophisticated cultural palette (saffron #D4700A, green #2E7D32, blue #1565C0)
- **Typography**: Mobile-optimized with proper line heights and weights
- **Spacing**: Consistent 4px-based system with touch-friendly targets
- **Components**: Button, Card, ProgressBar with variants

### ✅ State Management
- **Redux Toolkit**: Clean architecture with epic and quiz slices
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper action types
- **Async Thunks**: API integration with error handling

### ✅ Navigation
- **React Navigation**: Type-safe stack navigator
- **5 Core Screens**: Epic Library → Quiz → Results → Explanation → Deep Dive
- **Proper Flow**: Navigation params with full type checking

### ✅ API Integration
- **Service Layer**: Clean API abstraction with error handling
- **Backend Ready**: Connects to production PostgreSQL backend
- **Offline-First**: Designed for bulk quiz package downloads

## 🎨 Visual Mockups Available

### HTML Mockups Created
Located at: `/Users/cdkm2/epic-quiz-app/mockups/create-mockups.html`

**5 Pixel-Perfect Screens:**
1. **Epic Library** - Card-based literature selection
2. **Quiz Screen** - Clean question presentation with timer
3. **Results Screen** - Score visualization with review options
4. **Explanation Screen** - Answer feedback with cultural context
5. **Deep Dive Screen** - Rich educational content

**Design Features:**
- Sophisticated muted colors (not loud/garish)
- Cultural iconography (🕉️🏛️🏺)
- Mobile-first touch targets (44px minimum)
- Progress indicators and gamification elements

## 🔗 Backend Integration Ready

### Production API Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/epics` - Browse literature
- `GET /api/v1/quiz?epicId=...&count=10` - Generate quiz
- `POST /api/v1/quiz/submit` - Submit answers
- `GET /api/v1/questions/{id}/deep-dive` - Cultural content

### Backend Status: ✅ Production Ready
- PostgreSQL database with full schema
- RESTful API with validation middleware
- Quiz package generation for offline use
- Educational content with cultural context
- **All 18 essential tests passing**

## 📋 Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Screens (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Epic Library with real API data
- [ ] Quiz screen with question flow
- [ ] Results screen with score visualization

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Explanation screen with answer review
- [ ] Deep dive screen with cultural content
- [ ] Progress tracking and achievements

### Phase 3: Polish (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Animations and transitions
- [ ] Error handling and offline support
- [ ] Performance optimization

## 🎯 Solo Development Optimized

### Why This Architecture Works for Solo Development:
✅ **Clear Structure**: Easy to navigate and understand  
✅ **Type Safety**: Prevents runtime errors with TypeScript  
✅ **Component Reuse**: Button, Card, ProgressBar work everywhere  
✅ **Design Consistency**: Color/typography constants ensure uniformity  
✅ **Mockup Reference**: Pixel-perfect HTML shows exactly what to build  
✅ **Backend Ready**: No backend work needed, API is production-ready  

### Development Flow:
1. **Reference mockup** for exact visual design
2. **Use existing components** (Button, Card, etc.)
3. **Connect to Redux state** for data management
4. **Call API service** for backend integration
5. **Apply design system** constants for consistency

## 🚀 Ready to Implement

The foundation is complete and ready for screen implementation:
- **React Native app compiles successfully** ✅
- **Metro server starts without errors** ✅
- **All dependencies properly installed** ✅
- **Navigation and state management configured** ✅
- **Design system with cultural sensitivity** ✅
- **Production backend API available** ✅

**Next step**: Implement the Epic Library screen using the HTML mockup as the visual reference and connecting to the `/api/v1/epics` endpoint.
