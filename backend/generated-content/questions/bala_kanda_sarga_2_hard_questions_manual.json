      "question_text": "What philosophical principle underlying Hindu aesthetic theory is demonstrated by Valmiki's spontaneous transformation of 'shoka' (grief) into 'shloka' (verse)?",
      "options": [
        "The principle of dharma requiring poetic expression of truth",
        "The rasa theory that authentic emotion naturally manifests as artistic beauty",
        "The doctrine that divine inspiration bypasses human intellectual effort", 
        "The belief that suffering is the primary source of all great literature"
      ],
      "correct_answer_id": 1,
      "basic_explanation": "This exemplifies the fundamental principle of rasa theory in Sanskrit poetics - that genuine emotional experience (bhava) naturally transforms into aesthetic expression (rasa). Valmiki's grief (karuna rasa) spontaneously became the first shloka, demonstrating how authentic emotion is the wellspring of true poetry in Hindu aesthetic philosophy.",
      "original_quote": "शोकार्तस्य प्रवृत्तो मे श्लोको भवतु नान्यथा || १-२-१८ (śokārtasya pravṛtto me śloko bhavatu nānyathā)",
      "quote_translation": "A verse arose from me while I was tormented by grief, let it be a shloka and not otherwise.",

      "question_text": "How does Brahma's appearance as 'chaturmukha' (four-faced) in this Sarga symbolically parallel the four-fold structure of classical Sanskrit verse composition?",
      "options": [
        "Each face represents one of the four Vedas that inform epic composition",
        "The four faces symbolize the four padas (quarters) of a shloka meter",
        "Each face represents a different perspective on cosmic and poetic creation",
        "The four faces correspond to the four stages of poetic composition: inspiration, creation, revision, and transmission"
      ],
      "correct_answer_id": 2,
      "basic_explanation": "Brahma's four faces (chaturmukha) represent his ability to perceive all directions of creation simultaneously. This parallels the multidimensional nature of poetic creation - viewing the narrative from past, present, future, and eternal perspectives. Just as Brahma creates the cosmos through comprehensive vision, the epic poet must encompass all aspects of dharmic reality in verse.",
      "original_quote": "चतुर्मुखो महातेजा द्रष्टुं तं मुनिपुङ्गवम् || १-२-२३ (caturmukho mahātejā draṣṭuṁ taṁ munipuṅgavam)",

      "question_text": "What epistemological framework is established by the sequence of Narada's teaching, Valmiki's experiential realization, and Brahma's divine commission in terms of traditional knowledge transmission?",
      "options": [
        "Shruti (revealed knowledge) must be confirmed through personal spiritual practice",
        "The complete guru-parampara cycle: teaching (upadesa), realization (anubhava), and mandate (adhikara)",

        "Scriptural authority requires validation through miraculous signs and divine approval"
      ],
      "correct_answer_id": 1,
      "basic_explanation": "This Sarga demonstrates the complete traditional knowledge transmission cycle in Hindu epistemology: Narada provides upadesa (teaching) about Rama's greatness, Valmiki gains anubhava (direct experiential realization) through the birds' incident, and Brahma grants adhikara (divine authorization) to compose the epic. This establishes the Ramayana's authority through all three pillars of valid knowledge transmission.",
