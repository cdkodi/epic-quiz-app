Valmiki unintentionally utters a poem, which is rich in grammar and new in metre, of which he is very much confused as to why such a poem has come from his tongue. Brahma, the presiding deity of letters appears and ordains Valmiki to author Ramayana, excellent epic of Rama, for which purpose alone he gave such divine meter and grammar to him."

For endless years to come, O Hunter, never shall thy soul find peace /  Romesh C. Dutt. This verse has many comports of which a few are given hereunder: This verse is taken as  ma~NgalaacaraNa  to Ramayana, for any epic has to have  ma~Ngalaaadiini; ma~Ngalamadhyaani; ma~Ngalaantaani A good pious beginning, pious middle and pious ending. Because this verse has the letter maa  at its start and  maa   is   lakShmii vaacaka in Sanskrit. It is  aadivarNaH  The first letter   lokamaataa maa ramaa ma~Ngaladevataa  thus  amarakosha  says for Goddess Lakshmi. maa  = Goddess Lakshmi;  niShaada  = Oh! Vishnu [ for Goddess Lakshmi resides in the heart of Vishnu -  niShadiiti asmin iti niShaada ];  yat     = by which act;  krouncamithunaat  = the couple of demons, namely Ravana and Mandodari;  kaamamohitam = that impassioned one and stole Seetha;  ekam = that one, Ravana;  avadhiiH = you killed; by that act of yours; shaashvatiissamaa = everlasting for ages;  pratiShTaam = divine sanctity; tvam agamaH = you, get. Oh, the abode of Goddess Lakshmi, namely oh, Vishnu, by which act of your killing one male demon named Ravana, who in his passion abducted Seetha, and thus you eradicated the vice from the earth, for that you get an everlasting divine sanctity, as Rama, for ages to come. his benefit.  itaraam saadayati piiDayati iti niSaada  thus: Oh! Ravana;  krounchamithunaat = from the couple, say Rama and Seetha, who are flying from forest to forest like nest-less birds; ekam = one is, Seetha is;  avadhiiH  =you almost killed her by your torture of abducting pratiSTaam = your glory in Lanka, at its zenith, as per the kindness of Brahma;  maa agamaH = never get, hereafter. But this declination is not held right, for it is like a curse,  shaapa , and no epic starts with a curse. legend to Sage Valmiki because Brahma ordered that the legend of Rama is to be recorded. But Ramayana is full of pathos,  karuNa-shoka-rasa-pradhaana . If it is to be penned the writer too shall have heart that can outpour that mood. So when Valmiki is at the river banks, Rama, say Vishnu, came in the guise of a tribal, as with other mythological episodes like  kiraataarjuniiya etc., to test the capability of Valmiki in narrating pathos, and killed one bird. Valmiki reacted immediately and Vishnu s test is complete. But in exciting the mood of such holy sage, Vishnu / Rama gets a curse like separation from wife, as below. niShaada = oh tribal: Rama to Valmiki / Vishnu to mythology; for your killing one bird of the couple, to the misery of the female one;  shaashvatiiH  = as long as you live on this samaaH pratiSTaam = togetherness, with your wife;  maa agama = do not get. Oh! Rama, as long as you are on earth, you do not get the love of being together with your wife, because you killed one from the bird couple... and you have to live with your wife departed [to Lanka,] come again, and then departed [to forests.] But this is differed statement, since Vishnu does not require any personal testing of the capabilities of the writer of Ramayana. Brahma will look after such literary things. 4] The generally accepted meaning of this verse is this. Any epic s gist is to be said at the start or, at its commencement ---   kaavyaarthasuucanam aadaaveva niruupyate  --- Thus, the above verse included the meaning of whole of the epic, i]  maa niSaada = Goddess Lakshmi and Vishnu. Their marriage in their incarnations as Rama and Seetha, and Ramayana depicts this in  Bala Kanda . ii]  pratiSTaam tvam agamaH = renown, you get, by following your father s orders you have repaired to forests, without any political upheaval, thus get an everlasting renown as an obliging son  Ayodhyaa Kanda . iii]  shaashavatiissamaa = by dwelling in forest and eradicating demons and helping the saints and sages thus, you achieve an everlasting praise  Aranaya Kanda . iv]  krounchayoH = from the [atrocious] couple; gati kauTilya alpiibhaavayoH ; the atrocious Vali, and Tara couple;  ekam kaamamohitam  = passion filled one, i.e., Vali; avadhiiH= you killed, you killed Vali  KiShkindhaa Kanda . v]  krounchamithunaat = from the couple of lovely passionate birds here Rama and Seetha; niSaada  that ruffian Ravana,  kaamamohitam  lustfully,  ekam  one [i.e., avadhiiH  = almost killed, i.e., her residing in Lanka is as good as death  Sundara Kanda . vi]  krounchamithunaat  = from the atrocious, couple Ravana and Mandodari;  ekam avadhiiH you killed one [Ravana]  Yuddha Kanda . vii]  kaamamohitam = fascinated by desire, [  kaama  also means a longing, desire, let alone lusting]; Seetha is fascinated by her desire to see sage s wives in uttara Ramayana and thus she is sent to forests through Lakshmana. Hence seventh canto,  uttara Ramayana  is also"

[1-2-40] Comment: A poet never says poetry to satisfy his own instincts, but to imbue an involuntary imagination or passion in others when read or heard by the so called others. It is the empathy of that poetry. For Kalidasa it is  shR^ingaara , passion, for Bhavabhuti it is pity eko rasaH karuNaH ...  for Valmiki it is pathos, shoka. For this Kavi Kalidas says: niShaadaviddhaaNDajadarshanotthaH shlokatvamaapadyata yasya shokaH -- raghu va~Nsha 14-70  There are two texts for this one is,  shlokaH shlokatvam aagataH...  meaning that the verse originally structured metrically can now can be sung. Second is  shokaH shlokatvam aagataH...  the pathos of the poet attained the status of verse that is now being sung by the disciples, thus anyone can recite it."
