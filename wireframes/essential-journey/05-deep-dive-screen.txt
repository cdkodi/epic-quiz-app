║  📖 The Complete Story:              ║
║                                      ║
║  When Rama and Lakshmana were        ║
║  searching for Sita, they met        ║
║  Sugriva, who had been exiled by     ║
║  his brother Vali. Rama agreed to    ║
║  help Sugriva regain his throne in   ║
║  exchange for assistance in finding  ║
║  Sita.                               ║
║                                      ║
║  After Rama defeated Vali in single  ║
║  combat, Sugriva became the monkey   ║
║  king and honored his promise by     ║
║  sending thousands of monkeys to     ║
║  search across the world.            ║
║                                      ║

║  This alliance represents the Hindu  ║
║  ideal of dharma (righteous duty) -  ║

║  their promises despite personal     ║
║  cost. It shows how cooperation      ║
║  between different groups can        ║
║  achieve great things.               ║
